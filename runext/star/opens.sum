There are "OPEN NETS". 
"Open nets" have the same net name/number however not resistively connected;
they are formed by more than one "Resistively Connected Groups" (RCGs).
 You can find the open net names below.
StarRC will never be able to determine where the source of an open net is. as such,
StarRC has randomly chosen nodes on the open net between which a shorting ressistor
will be inserted. The coordinates listed in this file for the shorting resistors will
vary based on the settings for REDUCTION, REDUCTION_MAX_DELAY_ERROR, MODE, EXTRACTION.
